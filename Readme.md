# ML_Assignments

Collection of Machine Learning assignments organized by topic.

Each folder contains code, outputs, and a brief report for the respective assignment.

## Contents

- Regression & Classification
- Ensemble Learning (Bagging, Subagging, Boosting)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- K-Fold Cross Validation
- Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAE)

## Highlight

**Bike Demand Forecasting**

Predicted hourly bike rentals using ensemble regression models:
- Random Forest
- Subagging (BaggingRegressor)
- Gradient Boosting

Evaluated using 5-Fold Cross Validation.

Random Forest achieved the best performance due to strong variance reduction and robustness to noisy demand patterns.

## Usage

Navigate to any assignment folder and run the notebook or script provided.

```bash
cd Assignment_3_Bike_Demand_Forecasting
jupyter notebook Bike_Demand_Forecasting.ipynb
